# coding as a pa$$ion

mainly javascript at [wonderflow](https://www.wonderflow.co)

i am a [testing aficionado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/test-driven_development) & [agile enthusiast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agile_software_development)

into data visualization and statistics, machine learning is something i am getting my hands dirty from time to time.

generally all kinds of technology that brings value to me, read IoT, bots, apps, cli utilities, automation of all kinds.

## polyglot

*probably* wrote at least some **javascript** every day over the past five years

depending on the weather outside, i refresh my little but solid **elixir** skills

when i feel really bad, i console myself with some **haskell** (completed the course [FP101 at UNI Delft](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-functional-programming-delftx-fp101x-0))

had a chance to dabble with **python** in the context of python notebooks when i was doing my first steps with understand what ML is

when i was doing **ruby** i felt on top of the world

as a classic, **java**, but i prefer to stay away from it
