## projects

coding all kinds of tech fields that bring value to me, read IoT, Crypto, bots, apps, cli utilities, automation of all kinds.

regarding crypto, i launched [cryptosheet.cc](https://cryptosheet.cc/) in the summer of 2018 to satisfy my need to have all my balances and transactions on various crypto exchanges and wallet providers, in one single place: namely a spreadsheet.

in the field of IoT i made a watering system with a raspberry pi, camera, temperature and moisture sensors. the communication is handled via telegram. with the help of a bot i can water, request a snapshot or video of the garden and a timelapse of the past days.

other than [cryptosheet.cc](https://cryptosheet.cc/) i made [pomodoro.cc](https://pomodoro.cc/) in 2014. a clean timer that leverages the concepts of the Pomodoro Technique to help you to keep your focus. i encourage you to visit [pomodoro.cc](https://pomodoro.cc/).



## polyglot

*probably* wrote at least some **javascript** every day over the past five years

depending on the weather outside, i refresh my little but solid **elixir** skills

when i feel really bad, i console myself with some **haskell** (completed the course [FP101 at UNI Delft](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-functional-programming-delftx-fp101x-0))

had a chance to dabble with **python** in the context of python notebooks when i was doing my first steps understanding what ML is

when i was doing **ruby** i felt on top of the world

as a classic, **java**, but i prefer to stay away from it
