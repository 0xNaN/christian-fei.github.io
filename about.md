Clean Code, TDD, Refactoring and SOLID Principles are my special weapons to tame codebases.

Most of my OSS can be found on my [github profile](https://github.com/christian-fei).

I try to stay up to date with what people are coming up with, thus I read a lot, here you can find [my full pocket reading history](/pocket/) and [recommended books](/books/)

## OSS Projects

Coding in all kinds of tech fields that bring value to me, read IoT, Crypto, Bots, Apps, CLI utilities, Automation of all kinds.

My most recent project is [mega-scraper](https://github.com/christian-fei/mega-scraper): it aims to be a simple website scraping tool with proxy support, request blocking and various optimizations.

In the field of IoT I made a [watering system](https://github.com/christian-fei/garden) with a **raspberry pi, camera, temperature and moisture sensors**. the communication is handled via **telegram**. with the help of a bot I can water, request a snapshot or video of the garden and a timelapse of the past days. most importantly this enables me to water my plants remotely and seeing their current state through an image sent on a private telegram channel.

Right now I am probably **writing code** for
- [mega-scraper](https://github.com/christian-fei/mega-scraper) - scrape a website's content with puppeteer
- [this very blog](https://github.com/christian-fei/christian-fei.github.io)

Regarding crypto, I launched [cryptosheet.cc](https://cryptosheet.cc/) in the summer of 2018 to satisfy my need to have all my balances and transactions on different crypto exchanges and wallet providers, in one single place: namely a spreadsheet.

[cryptosheet.cc](https://cryptosheet.cc/) was a web application that wrote all your transactions and account details on a google spreadsheet. Supported exchanges were Coinbase, Coinbase Pro (formerly GDAX), Binance, Gatehub Wallet, IOTA Token, Ripple Wallet.

I made pomodoro.cc in 2014. it **was** a clean timer to help you to keep your focus.

I had to shut it down because of a [trademark issue](/posts/2020-02-13-So-Long-and-Thanks-for-All-the-Veggies/).


## Polyglot programmer

*probably* wrote at least some **JavaScript** every day over the past six years

Depending on the weather outside, I refresh my little but solid **Elixir** skills

When I feel really bad, I console myself with some **Haskell** (completed the course [FP101 at UNI Delft](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-functional-programming-delftx-fp101x-0))

Had a chance to dabble with **Python** in the context of python notebooks when I was doing my first steps understanding what ML is

When I was doing **Ruby** I felt on top of the world

As a classic, **Java**, but I prefer to stay away from it
