it's funny, i noticed it recently (read a few months ago). it all started here @ [933b1b8eef7482a6b5a960b0329e3f124cf22f29](https://github.com/christian-fei/christian-fei.github.io/blob/933b1b8eef7482a6b5a960b0329e3f124cf22f29/_includes/style.css) in [style.css](https://github.com/christian-fei/christian-fei.github.io/blob/master/_includes/style.css)

it looks like this (if you haven't noticed)

<div style="margin: 0 auto; border-radius: 50%; box-shadow: 10px 9px 24px lightgrey; height: 15em; width: 15em; background: #fe1"></div>

that's my new favorite color.
