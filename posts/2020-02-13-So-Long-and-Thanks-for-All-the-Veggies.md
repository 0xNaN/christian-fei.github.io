# üçÖ

As much as it hurts, this action had to be taken due to apparent trademark issues with the word <strong class="p">pomodoro</strong>.

<strong><strong class="p">pomodoro</strong>.cc has to close.</strong>

---

The creator of the P technique messaged me on 2020-02-10 on LinkedIn, essentially threatening me with legal action, to shut down <strong class="p">pomodoro</strong>.cc.

**arrogant people like this don't deserve my time**

The conversation contained a [link](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-trademark-guidelines) to his trademark guidelines and an example with the brand name "Armani".

Translated excerpt:

> Imagine that the brand is Armani‚Ä¶ and you decide to create your Armani fashion line ... or Amani or any distortion. Same thing with Pomodoro.

Another point he made was

> I don't think it will be enough to change the name to return to the norm

Whatever *that* means...

**I don't have the time to follow this absurd legal case, it's too unproductive for me.**

This is the best moment to thank my users for the support,
at the same time I‚Äôm sorry that the service ended this way.

Let [me](https://twitter.com/christian_fei) and [him](https://twitter.com/cirillof) know what you think about this whole thing.

So Long, and Thanks for All the Veggies,

Christian

# Moving on

Below you can see some stats and numbers about the service: stats since 2014 and data since end 2018.

# Stats

Stats at the time of writing:

- ~ **6k** monthly users and ~ **12k** monthly page views
- ~ **28k** users and ~ **69k** page views in 2019
- ~ **88k** users  and ~¬†**320k** page views since September 2014
- ~ **50** minutes average session duration
- exceptional growth in February 2020 (see below for hypothesis)

### Growth in February

This might be the most plausible reason for the timing of Cirillo's request. SEO and Twitter search apparently gave more weight to pomodoro.cc instead of to his own marketing stuff..
