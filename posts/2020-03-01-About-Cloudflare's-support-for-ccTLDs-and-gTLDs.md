Today I stumbled upon this official [doc by cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/tld-policies/) stating the current TLD - Policies.

It is like finding a treasure for me because I was looking for an official list of supported domains on Cloudflare, since I own a few `.cc`, `.ninja`, `.xyz` domains.

![cloudflare tld policies](/assets/images/posts/cloudflare-domains/cloudflare-tld.png)

`.cc` and `.xyz` are currently not supported (except for `.ninja`) as domains on Cloudflare.

The `.cc` ([Cocos Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.cc)) domain is part of the [ccTLDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_code_top-level_domain).

Short for **Country code top-level domain**.

`.xyz` on the other hand is part of the [gTLDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_top-level_domain), the **generic top-level domains**.

## Why?

I am trying to move all my domains to Cloudflare, mainly from old purchases on [namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) and [godaddy](https://godaddy.com/).

Cloudflare offers more than I could ask for, with smart caching, cdn, api (e.g. useful for purging the cache after a deploy), analytics, etc.
