I want software development to be **boring**.

Excessive tools, libraries, new frameworks to try: this all is gorgeous and fascinating, but what about *maintaining the current software* and tools, think if they can be *simplified (or even removed)* and made **boring**.

You should feel *comfortable and encouraged* to add a new feature or to refactor current code (since there are important and exhaustive **automatic tests and CI** in place).

**So simple to deliver new software and remove all the stress that you could do it even on Fridays and the weekend, from the beach, on your phone.**

Trying our best to *deliver quality software without all the usual hassle* (regressions, failures, etc.),
to have *more quality time* to think about **the product**.

*most* of their time: sometimes we, programmers, take costly "shortcuts" and produce *excessively complex & unmaintanable software*, without learning from our mistakes.

Let's try our best to create simple software, pipelines and practices for chill software development.
