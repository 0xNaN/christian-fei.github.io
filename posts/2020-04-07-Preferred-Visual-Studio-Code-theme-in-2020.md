Below my favourite Visual Studio Code theme I've come to like over time.

## plastic

[plastic](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=will-stone.plastic) as a number one, because of its Dark UI and small colour palette.

Prefer it mostly because for the clear visual highlight of the scope of block of code (scope, functions, dom, definitions etc.):

This is how it looks like
