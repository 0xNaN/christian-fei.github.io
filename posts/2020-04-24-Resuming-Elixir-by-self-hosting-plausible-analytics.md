As soon as Elixir was released a few years ago, I got into it and started learning and building things with of it. Still at the very beginning

Thanks to the help of some [dear](https://twitter.com/pdincau) [colleagues](https://twitter.com/joebew42) I had the opportunity to get valuable feedback and learn even more concepts about GenServers, the BEAM virtual machine, ETS and Erlang+Elixir in general.

I also went to my first Erlang+Elixir conf, and had the chance & honour to meet Joe Armstrong, ![#rememberingjoe](https://twitter.com/christian_fei/status/1119726548498767873?s=21).

On 2020/04/22, during quarantine, I decided to get back to Elixir (who knows: maybe even dabble with Erlang directly).

I post-poned this too much now, it's time to get back to the distributed programming world.

Without further ado, below my journey (in form of a daily journal) about learning more about Elixir (again), the BEAM, [plausible analytics](http://plausible.io/) and things discovered along the way!

Watched ["Elixir: A Mini-Documentary 2018"](https://doc.honeypot.io/elixir-documentary-2018/), very interesting video about the Elixir's history, touching on topics from the BEAM virtual machine, IoT scalability and general usage on the web services that can handle million of connections.
