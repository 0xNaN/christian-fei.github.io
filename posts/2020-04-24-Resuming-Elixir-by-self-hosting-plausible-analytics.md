As soon as Elixir was released a few years ago, I got into it and started learning and building things with it.

Thanks to the help of some [dear](https://twitter.com/pdincau) [colleagues](https://twitter.com/joebew42) I had the opportunity to get valuable feedback and learn even more concepts about GenServers, the BEAM virtual machine, ETS and Erlang+Elixir in general.

I also went to my first Erlang+Elixir conf, and had the chance & honour to meet Joe Armstrong, ![#rememberingjoe](https://twitter.com/christian_fei/status/1119726548498767873?s=21).

On 2020/04/22, during quarantine, I decided to get back to Elixir (who knows: maybe even dabble with Erlang directly).

I post-poned this too much now, it's time to get back to the distributed programming world.

Without further ado, below my journey (in form of a daily journal) about learning more about Elixir (again), the BEAM, [plausible analytics](http://plausible.io/) and things discovered along the way!

Forked the repo -> [christian-fei/plausible](https://github.com/christian-fei/plausible)

# 2020/04/24

Updated to latest elixir version with `brew upgrade elixir`.

Was on 1.9.1, 1.10.2 iss the latest stable release at the time of writing.

Watched ["Elixir: A Mini-Documentary 2018"](https://doc.honeypot.io/elixir-documentary-2018/), very interesting video about the Elixir's history, touching on topics from the BEAM virtual machine, IoT scalability and general usage on the web services that can handle million of connections.

Then this happened

# Getting started with the `plausible` elixir code

```bash
git clone git@github.com:christian-fei/plausible.git
cd plausible
```

Download deps

```bash
mix deps.get
```

Run the tests

```bash
mix test
```

This yields the error about the missing postgresql connection

```bash
09:11:52.095 [error] GenServer #PID<0.6248.0> terminating
** (DBConnection.ConnectionError) tcp connect (localhost:5432): connection refused - :econnrefused
    (db_connection) lib/db_connection/connection.ex:87: DBConnection.Connection.connect/2
    (connection) lib/connection.ex:622: Connection.enter_connect/5
    (stdlib) proc_lib.erl:249: :proc_lib.init_p_do_apply/3
Last message: nil
** (Mix) The database for Plausible.Repo couldn't be created: killed
```

So,let's boot up a postgresql instance with `docker`:

```bash
docker run -d -p 5432:5432 -v postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data --name postgres1 postgres
```

Now all the tests run fine, as expected:

```bash
~/D/p/plausible (master) mix test
.........................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Finished in 5.6 seconds
217 tests, 0 failures

Randomized with seed 396356
```

# Running locally with `mix phx.server`

```bash
mix phx.server
```

Got the error

```bash
[error] Postgrex.Protocol (#PID<0.5924.0>) failed to connect: ** (Postgrex.Error) FATAL 3D000 (invalid_catalog_name) database "plausible_dev" does not exist
```

Solved with `mix ecto.create`:

```bash
~/D/p/plausible (master) mix ecto
Ecto v3.4.2
A toolkit for data mapping and language integrated query for Elixir.

Available tasks:

mix ecto.create        # Creates the repository storage
mix ecto.drop          # Drops the repository storage
mix ecto.dump          # Dumps the repository database structure
mix ecto.gen.migration # Generates a new migration for the repo
mix ecto.gen.repo      # Generates a new repository
mix ecto.load          # Loads previously dumped database structure
mix ecto.migrate       # Runs the repository migrations
mix ecto.migrations    # Displays the repository migration status
mix ecto.reset         # Alias defined in mix.exs
mix ecto.rollback      # Rolls back the repository migrations
mix ecto.setup         # Alias defined in mix.exs
~/D/p/plausible (master) mix ecto.create
The database for Plausible.Repo has been created
```

Run the migrations:

```bash
~/D/p/plausible (master) mix ecto.migrate

11:16:39.587 [info]  == Running 20181201181549 Plausible.Repo.Migrations.AddPageviews.change/0 forward

11:16:39.589 [info]  create table pageviews

11:16:39.604 [info]  == Migrated 20181201181549 in 0.0s

11:16:39.636 [info]  == Running 20181214201821 Plausible.Repo.Migrations.AddNewVisitorToPageviews.change/0 forward

11:16:39.636 [info]  alter table pageviews

11:16:39.638 [info]  == Migrated 20181214201821 in 0.0s

...

```

Almost there:

```bash
~/D/p/plausible (master) mix phx.server
[info] Running PlausibleWeb.Endpoint with cowboy 2.7.0 at 0.0.0.0:8000 (http)
[error] Could not start node watcher because script "/Users/christian/Documents/projects/plausible/assets/node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js" does not exist. Your Phoenix application is still running, however assets won't be compiled. You may fix this by running "cd assets && npm install".
[info] Access PlausibleWeb.Endpoint at http://localhost:8000
```

I had to compile the `assets` with `npm install`, after that, everything seems fine:

```bash
~/D/p/plausible (master) mix phx.server
[info] Running PlausibleWeb.Endpoint with cowboy 2.7.0 at 0.0.0.0:8000 (http)
[info] Access PlausibleWeb.Endpoint at http://localhost:8000

webpack is watching the filesâ€¦
```

Uuuuuuuh! It's working!

### Registering 127.0.0.1:8080

![plausible-registration.png](/assets/images/posts/elixir/plausible-registration.png)

Included the following script on my blog to set up local tracking:

```html
<script async defer data-domain="127.0.0.1" src="https://plausible.io/js/plausible.js"></script>
```

Clicked the activation link printed in the console, instead of the email (since the email wasn't sent).

---

While I set up the local tracking for `127.0.0.1:8080`, I noticed that the website wasn't registering.

It kept showing "Waiting for first pageview on 127.0.0.1:8080"

So, looking through the source, I noticed that in the files `p.js` and `plausible.js`, there was a guard to ignore local tracking:

```js
if (/^localhost$|^127(?:\.[0-9]+){0,2}\.[0-9]+$|^(?:0*\:)*?:?0*1$/.test(window.location.hostname)) return ignore('website is running locally');
```

Commented this line, and my local site is finally set up!
