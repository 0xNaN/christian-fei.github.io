> privacy **matters**, and coherence **costs**

Do a self-examination, and think about what matters to you.

**Stop being the product** and **start using an ethical and privacy-aware product** instead.

No conspiracy theories here. Just my thoughts.

**If you don't agree, that's fine. Don't be a hater and continue your path.**

A small premise: nobody is perfect. I may contradict myself even without noticing. I **try** to be *as coherent as possible*.

For feedback, addionational alternatives, or simply a discussion: please let me know [@christian_fei](https://twitter.com/christian_fei) or contact me via crifei [at] protonmail.com

It's useless to say that every service has other alternatives, these are my opinions. So, here we go.

# Email

Gmail is probably the most widely used email service.

Ditch that.

Go with [ProtonMail](https://proton.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=15&aff_id=1721&source=blog).

*Free, but pay for it to get the most out of it and support the cause.*

# Website analytics

Are you using Google Analytics on your websites?

Don't.

Use [plausible analytics](https://plausible.io/): [self-host it](/posts/2020-04-24-Resuming-Elixir-by-self-hosting-plausible-analytics/) or *pay for it*.

# VPN

Don't use a free VPN. A few links to bring the point home:

- [Don't use VPN services](https://gist.github.com/joepie91/5a9909939e6ce7d09e29)
- [Police Seize Two Perfect Privacy VPN Servers](https://torrentfreak.com/police-seize-two-perfect-privacy-vpn-servers-160902/)

Definitely use [ProtonVPN](https://proton.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=10&aff_id=1721&source=blog).

Trial + free limited usage. *Pay for it, you won't regret it*. [You can get the bundle (including ProtonMail) to save 20%](https://proton.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=15&aff_id=1721).

Alternatively, [self-host it with Algo](https://github.com/trailofbits/algo).

# Socials

Ditch FB, forever. "Delete" your account once and for all, stay in touch with your loved ones in other ways.

Mastodon could be an alternative, not necessarily for your relatives but for personal use and to connect with the community on a certain instance.

There are various ones I signed up for like unfiltered news sources and thematic instances of interest.

# Messaging

No Whatsapp. [Try signal](https://www.signal.org/).

Telegram could also be fine.

# Video conferencing

No Google Meet, no Classroom, screw Zoom.

Use [jitsi](https://jitsi.org/), self-hosted if you feel so inclined.

# News

Ditch national newspapers that you're aware to write biased stories and try to indoctrinate you.

That's up to you understanding it; not mentioning any.

Use indipendent and unbiased, local and global news sources that you know of. If possible try to support them with a donation.

# Phone

Use a Nokia 3310.

Kidding.

This is probably the most difficult part. Wouldn't know how to find a good compromise, evaluate by yourself.
