> Coherence **costs** and Privacy **matters**.

Do a self-examination, and think about what matters to you.

**Stop being the product** and **start using an ethical and privacy-aware product** instead.

No conspiracies here. Just real world cases.

A small premise: nobody is perfect, I may contradict myself even without noticing. I **try** to be *as coherent as possible*.

# Email

Gmail is probably the most widely used email service.

Ditch that.

Go with [ProtonMail](https://proton.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=15&aff_id=1721&source=blog).

*Free, but pay for it to get the most out of it and support the cause.*

# Website analytics

Are you using Google Analytics on your websites?

Don't.

Use [plausible analytics](https://plausible.io/): [self-host it](/posts/2020-04-24-Resuming-Elixir-by-self-hosting-plausible-analytics/) or *pay for it*.

# VPN

Don't use a free VPN. A few links to bring the point home:

- [Don't use VPN services](https://gist.github.com/joepie91/5a9909939e6ce7d09e29)
- [Police Seize Two Perfect Privacy VPN Servers](https://torrentfreak.com/police-seize-two-perfect-privacy-vpn-servers-160902/)

Definitely use [ProtonVPN](https://proton.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=10&aff_id=1721&source=blog).

Trial + free limited usage. *Pay for it and you won't regret it*.

Alternatively, [self-host it with Algo](https://github.com/trailofbits/algo).

# Socials

Ditch FB forever. "Delete" your account once and for all, stay in touch with your loved ones in other ways.

Mastodon could be an alternative, not necessarily for your relatives but for personal use and to connect with the community on a certain instance.

There are various ones I signed up for:

- unfiltered news sources
- thematic instances of your interest

# Messaging

No Whatsapp. [Try signal](https://www.signal.org/).

Telegram could also be fine.

# News

Ditch national newspapers that you're aware to write biased stories and try to indoctrinate you.

That's up to you understanding it; not mentioning any.

Use indipendent and unbiased, local and global news sources that you know of. If possible try to support them with a donation.


# Phone

Use a Nokia 3310.

Kidding.

This is probably the most difficult part. Wouldn't know how to find a good compromise, validate by yourself.
