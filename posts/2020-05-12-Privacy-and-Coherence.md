> privacy **matters**, and coherence **costs**

Do a self-examination, and think about what matters to you.

**To me, privacy is about consciousness, possibility and choice.**

**Start using an ethical and privacy-aware product**.

No conspiracy theories here. Just my thoughts.

**I'm not an expert. These are just my opinions. If you don't agree, that's fine.**

*A small premise: nobody is perfect. I may contradict myself even without noticing.*

I **try** to be *as coherent as possible*.

One could say: if you don't own your encryption keys, there is no real privacy.

# Email

Gmail is probably the most widely used email service.

Move away from that.

Go with [ProtonMail](https://proton.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=15&aff_id=1721&source=blog).

I like ProtonMail because it allows you to manage your encryption keys, has a pretty simple UI, no fuzz and allows to send and receive secure and encrypted emails.

You can export the default ones, import your own encryption keys etc. All communication is secured with end-to-end encryption. No IP-logs are retained.

Their code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ProtonMail).

# Phone

Use a Nokia 3310.

Kidding (actually, not so much).

Your phone usage and habits are probably the most difficult to change.

Your phone might be the greatest pain point of your privacy, since it can be seen as an "extension" of yourself. You probably have it with you most of the time too.

If you feel so inclined, you could try a [Librem 5](https://puri.sm/products/librem-5/) or a [PinePhone](https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/).

*These phones are even shipping in late May 2020!*

(Do you remember the FirefoxOS Phone? I remember as I got one for free when Firefox was beta-testing it, and it felt really weird at that time.)

With these novel approaches and businesses around privacy oriented phones, I think we are headed in the right direction, since I feel that manufacturers and the community behind are growing year after year.


# Website analytics

Are you using Google Analytics on your websites?

Don't.

Use [plausible analytics](https://plausible.io/): [self-host it](/posts/2020-04-24-Resuming-Elixir-by-self-hosting-plausible-analytics/) or *pay for it*.

Personally like it because it's a simple, unobtrusive & open-source website analytics tool. It doesnâ€™t use cookies and is fully compliant with GDPR, CCPA and PECR.

Another interesting analytics service is [fathom analytics](https://usefathom.com/).

# VPN

Don't use a free VPN. A few links to bring the point home:

- [Don't use VPN services](https://gist.github.com/joepie91/5a9909939e6ce7d09e29)
- [Police Seize Two Perfect Privacy VPN Servers](https://torrentfreak.com/police-seize-two-perfect-privacy-vpn-servers-160902/)

Definitely use [ProtonVPN](https://proton.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=10&aff_id=1721&source=blog).

No user logs or data shared with third parties.

Alternatively, [self-host a VPN with Algo](https://github.com/trailofbits/algo).

# Socials

Ditch FB, forever. "Delete" your account once and for all, stay in touch with your loved ones in other ways.

Mastodon could be an alternative, not necessarily for your relatives but for personal use and to connect with the community on a certain instance.

There are various ones I signed up for like unfiltered news sources and thematic instances of interest.

# Messaging

No Whatsapp.

[Try signal](https://www.signal.org/).

Telegram could also be fine.

As always, this is a hairy and conflicting matter. Also Whatsapp was "fine" some time ago, in the sense that there wasn't FB behind, there weren't various leaks of information regarding plain-text password etc.

So it's a difficult matter, right now I'm using Signal and Telegram. Let's see what the future holds.

# Discussion & KB

Atlassian Suite & Jira, no thanks, if possible.

**What else is out there?** Let me know [@christian_fei](https://twitter.com/christian_fei).

Use [discourse](https://www.discourse.org/).

# Video

If you can, avoid YouTube.

Use decentralized alternatives like [d.tube](https://d.tube/) and [lbry.tv](https://lbry.tv/).

They are getting more and more traction over time, maybe one day you can completely watch all your information needs and cat-videos on a platform different than YouTube.

# Video conferencing

No Google Meet, no Classroom, screw Zoom.

Use [jitsi](https://jitsi.org/), self-hosted if you feel so inclined.

# News

Ditch newspapers that you're aware of, that write biased stories and don't report on certain topics because of profit and interests.

That's up to you understanding it; not mentioning any.

Use indipendent and unbiased, local and global news sources that you know of. If possible try to support them with a donation.

That's all from my side.

I try to be aware what I do and share with third-parties as much as possible, although it seems to be getting more difficult every day.

Again, I'm not an expert on this, but I try my best.

Let me know your opinion and feedback [@christian_fei](https://twitter.com/christian_fei).
