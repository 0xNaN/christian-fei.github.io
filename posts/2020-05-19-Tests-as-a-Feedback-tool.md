Your Continuous Integration Pipeline is failing all the time, because of silly mistakes on the developer side?

Common "reasons" and mistakes could be:

E.g.:

- I forgot to run the tests!
- The tests are flaky as snowflakes!
- I ran the tests, and they passed on my machine! I swear to Kent Beck and Martin Fowler!
- [put more excuses here]
