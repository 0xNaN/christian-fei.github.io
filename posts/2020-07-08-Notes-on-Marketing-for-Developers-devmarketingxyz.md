Purchased a convenient bundle *a few years ago*. Time passes, and nearly forgot about the book and course.
Priorities. Life. You know, first world problems.

Resumed the course, this time for real, and I’m trying to motivate myself by taking notes about my learnings.

# 1. How to succeed
“Build the right product”, sounds cliché, but that’s the hard truth.

“Build something people want” is another often used quote.

If your product gets recommended by other people,  by word of mouth, it’s even better. That’s when you know you hit the nail on the head.

Don’t fall in love with your ideas. Validate them first, ASK the right people if they would be interested and if they are solving a problem they are having in a different way.

“Inspiration doesn’t always lead to great products”.

Don’t focus on the idea, or on yourself. Focus on the customer and if your idea could solve a problem they are actually struggling with.

Talk to people. Talk. to. people.

If you want to do good marketing, find an actual problem people have, and that they will pay you to solve it.

# 2. Choose the right market
Not all markets or niches are the same, in terms of customers willing to pay for your product.

Evaluate if a specific customer base are motived to spend money, acquisition of potential customers is feasible, and that the niche is big enough to bring home some $$$.

Find customer for whom you want to work.

Get started by determining topics you’re passionate about, evaluate a good market (are they willing to pay).
Do your research, don’t necessarily look at competitors, look at the issues your potential customers face, and if you can solve their problem(s).
Now you can decide wether it could be worth to build a product for them or not.

Remember: you build a product for THE CUSTOMER. Not for yourself. Not to try a fancy new framework/library/technology.

FOCUS ON THE CUSTOMER, damnit.

Try to answer these questions:
- is the market quite easy to reach (socials, cold calling, email, others)
- does the market have buying power?
- are your potential customers willing to improve the way they work?
- is the market too small and profits could be difficult to achieve?
- do you like working and solving the problems your customers are having? are you passionate about the niche?
