After using Brave for almost a year, I can extract some stats from its usage over time:

- 152,906 trackers blocked
- 2,26GB of bandwidth saved
- "2,1 hours saved" (no clue how this is calculated)


But more importantly, I made some bucks!

In Brave browser you can opt-in to the Brave Rewards program, which enables a BAT (Basic Attention Token) Wallet where the funds will be stored.

Through the third-party service [uphold.com](https://uphold.com/) you can manage those funds and withdraw them.

I can't say that the ads were very relevant all the time, but certainly more accurate to my interests than other ads showed on the Web.

Nevertheless, in the last year I managed to gather 13,5 $ (11,5 â‚¬)!

Not too bad. I didn't expect much from BAT and Brave Rewards, but it's still something.

Still better than the shady crypto faucets ðŸ˜„
