**Struggling with dozens of newsletters in your inbox?** (or should I say "Imbox"? &lt;/troll&gt;)

I use this super simple organizational trick / habit when signing up for newsletters.

## Using an email alias

When I sign up to newsletters I always use the following email pattern:

```
[username]+newsletter@...
```

Can't remember if this was GMail-only or not, nevertheless it works with [protonmail](https://proton.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=15&aff_id=1721&source=blog) too for example.

## Newsletter emails should be silent

Newsletters can be read with calm, a day / a week later and can still provide the same value.

I prefer to get notifications only for important things, and newsletter certainly don't fall into that category.

So, I set up a filter on [protonmail](https://proton.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=15&aff_id=1721&source=blog)

![protonmail filters](/assets/images/posts/newsletter-trick/protonmail-filters.png)

This filter takes every email with the before mentioned pattern (`[username]+newsletter@...`) and puts it in the folder "News".

This is how the filter looks like:

The folder "News" is programmed to never send me a notification for incoming emails:

This is how I reduce the newsletter-stress I was perceiving.

I am interested to know if you are experiencing a similar fatigue.
